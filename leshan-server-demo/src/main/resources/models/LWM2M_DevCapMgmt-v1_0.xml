If the value of this resource is “True” the Device Capability is in Enabled State. If the value is “False” the Device Capability is in Disabled State;
The ‘Attached’ and ‘Enabled’ resources are independent. A Device Capability MAY have ‘True’ as value for ‘Enabled’ Resource while having ‘False’ as value for the ‘Attached’ Resource. That means the Device Capability is still not available and can’t be used until it is attached to the Device, but will be useable once the Device Capability is attached.
